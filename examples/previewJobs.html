							<p>The headquarter of Cargo Media is located in the heart of "Kleinbasel" at Clara district. It's undisputedly a spot in Basel that deserves the description of a cultural melting pot. The young team works in a wide-open space office that sometimes is referred to as "the jungle" since our CEO positioned a small number of plants to fill the room. Jokes aside, the atmosphere is very informal; we foster a friendly companionship where contact doesn't end once work is finished.</p>
							<p>Because our fridge is always filled with free drinks, beers and ice cream, we're always prepared for a challenging game session in our game room.</p>
							<p>We facilitate an open-minded vibe where you can realize your own ideas and live out your creativity and enjoy flexible work hours. This is very important to foster a dynamic start-up environment, where “work” is more than “work”. It's an exchange of ideas, mutual learning and most importantly, good fun. Let's grow together.</p>

					<h2>About <strong>Basel</strong></h2>
					<h3>Basel is Awesome</h3>
					<div class="columns two">
						<div class="fixed left">

						<div class="flex right">
							<p>Basel is awesome. Here are some things about Basel that you should know:</p>
							<p>Basel is located where the Swiss, French and German borders meet; that's why the metropolitan region with roughly 830,000 inhabitants is also called “the three-border area”. It's definitely one of many reasons Basel is one of the most important cultural centers in Switzerland. The city holds a large number of theaters and museums like the Museum of Fine Arts and the world famous Foundation Beyeler build by Renzo Piano. Additionally, Art Basel, an international contemporary art fair, is held each year; Art Basel has been designated by The Daily Telegraph as "The Olympics of the Art World".</p>
							<p>Sport has also a significant role to play in Basel’s cultural history. The local hero Roger Federer, the best tennis player who ever lived on this planet, is a fan of the local football club FC Basel which play their home games at the 38512 ‘’capacity St. Jakob-Park, build by Herzog & de Meuron, world renowned local architects who also built the Bird's Nest in Beijing and the Allianz Arena in Munich.</p>
							<p>With its central location in Europe, Basel is connected to all major European cities by the EuroAirport, making Basel a top location to start small vacation trips.</p>
							<p>Basel is also a major industrial center for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, with Roche and Novartis having their headquarters in Basel. This is also the main reason that you'll meet a lot of ex-pats if you go for an after work beer.</p>
							<p>The city itself is divided into two parts by the river Rhein. There is the bigger Basel and the smaller Basel. The bigger Basel is probably best known for its historic center and the many shops, where no wish is left unmet. The smaller Basel is the more vibrant and young part of the city, with a lot of bars, clubs and cheap apartments, which makes it a center for students and young creatives, who enjoy the diverse atmosphere. That was also a reason why the Cargo Media team never wanted to leave this part of town.</p>
							<p>There is one important fact about Basel we nearly forgot to mention: according to an unofficial report, Basel has the most sunny days in Switzerland and a Californian like very warm summer!</p>
